<!-- ## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
Hyper text transfer protocol - how you get data to/from a server

- What is a URL?
Uniform resource locator - web address

- What is DNS?
Domain name system - converts urls into IP addresses

- What is a query string?
Key-value pairs that can be added to the URL

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
Get - when you are retrieving info from a server
Post - when you are sending info to a server

- What is an HTTP request?
Request from device to server

- What is an HTTP response?
Response from a server to a device (e.g. 404, 200, etc.)

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Give information about the request or response. Host, cookie, etc.

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
Broswer converts URL to IP address with DNS, browser makes request to IP address, server sends a response, the browser makes a DOM and finds any other related files, the browswer makes additional HTTP requests for different resources from server.

## ****Part Two: Practice Tools****

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.

## **Part Three: Explore Dev Tools**

Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

## **Part Four: Explore the URL API**

At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

[Read about the URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class. -->
